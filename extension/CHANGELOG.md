# Changelog

## 1.1.8

- Replace comparison and interactive rebase revision dropdowns with editable, searchable pickers in the shared full graph UI.
- Group the current branch and upstream first, then common branches (main, master, season, dev, develop), other local branches, remote branches and tags.
- Support mouse selection, arrow keys, Enter and Escape while retaining direct commit IDs and revision expressions.

版本比较与交互式变基的选择框支持输入筛选，当前分支及上游置顶，season、dev 等常用分支优先，并保留直接输入提交号及版本表达式的能力。

## 1.1.7

- Strengthen force-push protection with `--force-with-lease --force-if-includes` so background fetch cannot silently weaken the lease check.
- Desktop automatic refresh/fetch timers are not enabled in the extension.

强制推送增加远端提交已在本地整合的检查，避免后台 fetch 削弱保护。扩展版不启用桌面版定时器。

## 1.1.6

- Append native Git command names to Chinese action labels across menus, buttons, dialogs and the command palette.
- Add repository settings shared by the desktop app and extension. Disabling revert blocks starting and continuing revert at execution time; abort remains available. Linked worktrees share the setting, other repositories are unaffected.

中文操作名称增加对应 Git 命令；新增两端共用的仓库级“禁用 revert”设置，执行入口拦截新建和继续 revert，仍允许中止。

## 1.1.5

- Show current-line blame on both sides of diffs, including added, deleted and unchanged lines. Use each side's revision or index snapshot; uncommitted additions are labeled as uncommitted.

修复 diff 两侧的行末提交信息：新增、删除和未修改行均按各自版本显示归属，尚未提交的新增行显示“尚未提交”。

## 1.1.4

- Fix duplicate quick-diff visibility commands when multiple repositories are open.
- Read status alone for working-file changes and avoid redraws when status is unchanged; parallelize independent Git reads.
- Keep existing graph rows visible while refreshing and show authors in the compact graph.
- Inspect the first 8000 bytes for NUL when detecting binary revision contents.

修复多仓库 quick-diff 重复注册，减少重复读取与重绘，提交图刷新时保留旧行并显示作者，调整历史文件的二进制识别范围。

## 1.1.3

- Keep branch lists in a fixed order so clicking a branch does not move it away from the pointer.
- Highlight the selected branch, tag or stash in the graph sidebar and tick the checked-out branch.
- Keep local branches before remote branches in editor pickers, without recent-use reordering.

分支列表不再按最近使用重排；点击后的行保持原位并高亮，当前分支显示对钩，扩展选择框仍保持本地分支优先。

## 1.1.2

- Show each branch's latest commit (author, short ID, subject and age) in the branch picker.
- Choose the commit graph's branch from the same top picker instead of a dropdown.
- Create branches from the branch picker and the graph dialog: names follow `(fix|feat)_(S|C|SC)_lowerCamelCase` and the starting branch can be chosen. Existing branch names are unaffected.

分支选择框在每个分支下显示最新提交；提交图显示的分支改在顶部选择框中选择；新建分支时提示并校验命名规则 `(fix|feat)_(S|C|SC)_小驼峰`，可选择从哪个分支签出。已有分支名称不受影响。

## 1.1.1

- Sort branches by recent use, with local branches before remote branches in the editor picker.
- Allow locally ignoring multiple selected untracked files in one operation.
- Open stash contents without applying them, including files saved with `git stash -u`.
- Replace unreliable revision datalist choices with clickable selectors in compare and interactive rebase tools.

分支按最近使用排序，扩展的本地分支优先于远程分支；支持批量将选中的未跟踪文件设为仅本机忽略；贮藏无需应用即可查看；修复比较版本与交互式变基的版本下拉选项无法点击。

## 1.1.0

- Add repository comparisons, reviewed-file markers, remote management, interactive rebase and reflog recovery to the full graph interface.
- Add clone/init, image previews and read-only streaming pages for large patches.
- Page file/line history and search beyond 200 entries; map unchanged lines in dirty buffers back to HEAD.
- Allow native text revision limits of 4–64 MiB. Windows local workspaces only; PR/Issue collaboration and cloud patches are excluded.

新增整仓比较、审阅标记、远程管理、交互式变基、Reflog 恢复、克隆/初始化、图片预览及大补丁分页；历史可加载更多，本地修改后的未变选区仍可查询行历史。仅完善 Windows 本地功能。

## 1.0.1

- Adopt the MIT license and include it in the VSIX and desktop installer.
- Update direct downloads to the licensed release. Runtime behavior is unchanged from 1.0.0.

First stable release for Windows x64, with English and Simplified Chinese UI.

- Fix duplicate text-model errors when opening unstaged diffs and inline changes.
- Share revision reads between gutter change markers and diff editors.

- Include native commit-file diffs, branch filters, nested repositories and local ignore/tracking controls from the preview releases.
- Provide a direct VSIX download for VS Code and Cursor, alongside the desktop installer.

首次正式版，提供 Windows x64 桌面安装包和扩展 VSIX，内置英文与简体中文。修复未暂存差异及行内改动详情的重复模型错误，复用行边标记与差异编辑器的版本读取；支持关闭、重新打开仓库，并在刷新和重载后保留关闭状态。
